        "question": "John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph and then turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home.  He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?",
        "baseline_answer": "John initially drives 3 hours × 60 mph = **180 miles** away from home. \n\n- **First 2 hours**: Standstill traffic → no movement.  \n- **Next 0.5 hours**: 30 mph × 0.5 = **15 miles** toward home → 180 - 15 = **165 miles** remaining.  \n- **Remaining 1.5 hours**: 80 mph × 1.5 = **120 miles** toward home → 165 - 120 = **45 miles**.  \n\n**Answer:** 45 miles from home.",

            "answer": "To determine how far John is from home at the end of his 4-hour return trip, we need to analyze the distances he covered during each segment of his journey.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Initial Distance from Home**\n\nJohn first drives **3 hours** at a speed of **60 mph** away from home.\n\n$$\n\\text{Distance from home} = 60 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} = 180 \\, \\text{miles}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Return Trip Breakdown**\n\nJohn turns around and attempts to return home in **4 hours**, but his return trip is disrupted:\n\n- **First 2 hours**: Standstill traffic (no movement)\n- **Next 0.5 hours**: Drives at **30 mph**\n- **Remaining time**: Drives at **80 mph**\n\nLet’s compute the total time spent driving during the return trip:\n\n$$\n\\text{Driving time} = 0.5 \\, \\text{hours} + 1.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 2 \\, \\text{hours}\n$$\n\nNow, calculate the distance covered during the driving segments:\n\n- **At 30 mph for 0.5 hours**:\n\n$$\n\\text{Distance} = 30 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 0.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 15 \\, \\text{miles}\n$$\n\n- **At 80 mph for 1.5 hours**:\n\n$$\n\\text{Distance} = 80 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 1.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 120 \\, \\text{miles}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Total Distance Covered on Return Trip**\n\n$$\n\\text{Total distance covered} = 15 \\, \\text{miles} + 120 \\, \\text{miles} = 135 \\, \\text{miles}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Distance from Home**\n\nJohn was initially **180 miles** away from home. After covering **135 miles** back toward home, the remaining distance is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Final distance from home} = 180 \\, \\text{miles} - 135 \\, \\text{miles} = 45 \\, \\text{miles}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{45}\n$$\n\nJohn is **45 miles** away from home at the end of the 4-hour return trip.",
