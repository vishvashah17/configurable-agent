            "answer": "To determine the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we start by analyzing the given relationships and applying them systematically.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Define Variables and Relationships**\n\nLet:\n- $ S $ = number of sheep in Seattle\n- $ C $ = number of sheep in Charleston\n- $ T $ = number of sheep in Toulouse\n\nFrom the problem:\n1. $ T = 2C $  (Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston)\n2. $ C = 4S $  (Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle)\n3. $ S = 20 $  (Seattle has 20 sheep)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Number of Sheep in Each City**\n\n**Charleston:**\n$$\nC = 4S = 4 \\times 20 = 80\n$$\n\n**Toulouse:**\n$$\nT = 2C = 2 \\times 80 = 160\n$$\n\n**Seattle:**\n$$\nS = 20 \\quad \\text{(given)}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Compute the Total Number of Sheep**\n\nAdd the number of sheep in all three cities:\n$$\n\\text{Total} = S + C + T = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{260}\n$$",
