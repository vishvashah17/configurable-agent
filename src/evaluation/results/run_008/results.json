        "question": "Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. She also receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. If Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, how much are her earnings for this week?",
        "baseline_answer": "Eliza's earnings are calculated as follows:  \n- **Regular pay**: 40 hours × $10 = **$400**  \n- **Overtime pay**: 5 hours × (1.2 × $10) = 5 × $12 = **$60**  \n- **Total earnings**: $400 + $60 = **$460**  \n\nAnswer: $460",
